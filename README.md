# MintyDEFI v2.0: MintME's next decentralized exchange
## Why MintyDEFI v2.0?
1. lower gas usage when compared to MintyDEFI v1.0
2. no protocol-wide dev fees (MintyDEFI v1.0 had a 0.05% dev fee)
## Why DeFi and not MintME.com?
Here's are the 3 benefits DeFi exchanges have to tradition exchanges
1. instant trading - no waiting for people to buy/sell
2. very high liquidity - no bid-ask spreads
3. DeFi exchanges are more secure than traditional exchanges
## What MintyDEFI v1.0 and MintyDEFI v2.0 aims to do
1. Make DeFi suitable for day trading
2. Give people an alternative to that stupid MintME.com exchange with it's stupid bid-ask spread
3. Introduce a DeFi protocol to the MintME blockchain, to change the MintME ecosystem forever
## But I still want to trade on MintME.com
I'm very sorry, but this type of huge bid-ask spread makes it nearly impossible to net a profit on MintME.com
